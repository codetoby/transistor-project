## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Java JDK 11 or later
Maven 3.6 or later
Docker
A suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Setup Database
1. Run docker compose from project root directory:
```bash 
$ docker compose up -d
```

2. Get container name:
```bash
$ docker ps
```

3. Copy files to the container:
```bash
$ docker cp ./resources/gtfs <container-name>:/
$ docker cp ./resources/CompleteZipCodes.txt <container-name>:/
$ docker cp ./create_table.sql <container-name>:/
```

4. Access the container:
```bash
$ docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
```

5. Access mysql as root (root password can be found in docker compose file):
```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```

6. Set the local infile variable in mysql command line:
```bash
mysql> SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;
```

7. Exit mysql server:
```bash
mysql> exit
```

8. Connect to the server with local-infile system variable:
```bash
$ mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
```

9. Run script to create and fill tables:
```bash
mysql> source create_table.sql
```
