## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Java JDK 11 or later
Maven 3.6 or later
Docker
A suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Setup Database
1. Run docker compose from project root directory:
```bash 
$ docker compose up -d
```

2. Get container name:
```bash
$ docker ps
```

3. Copy files to the container:
```bash
$ docker cp ./gtfs <container-name>:/
$ docker cp ./scripts/zipcodes/CompleteZipCodes.txt <container-name>:/
$ docker cp ./scripts/sql/setup_database.sql <container-name>:/
```

4. Access the container:
```bash
$ docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
```

5. Access mysql as root (root password can be found in docker compose file):
```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```

6. Set the local infile variable in mysql command line:
```bash
mysql> SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;
```

7. Exit mysql server:
```bash
mysql> exit
```

8. Connect to the server with local-infile system variable:
```bash
$ mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
```

9. Run script to create and fill tables:
```bash
mysql> source ./scripts/sql/setup_database.sql
```


### Installation

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codetoby/transistor-project.git .
```
2. Install Maven dependencies:
```bash
    mvn install
```
3. Compile the project:
```bash
    mvn compile
```

## Database Configuration Setup

To configure the database settings for the application, please create a new .env file in the root directory of the project and provide the following properties:
1. `MYSQL_DATABASE` - The URL of the database server.
2. `MYSQL_USER` - The username to connect to the database.
3. `MYSQL_PASSOWRD` - The password to connect to the database.
4. `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSOWRD` - The name of the database to connect to.

For guidance on the format and available configuration options, refer to the example file provided at:

```bash
.env.example
```

## Usage
```bash
mvn exec:java -D"exec.mainClass"="org.group14.App"
```

## Running the Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
mvn test
```
### Code Coverage
```bash
mvn jacoco:report
```
This will generate a report in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`
